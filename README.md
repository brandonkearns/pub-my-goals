## What are your goals over the next 11 weeks?

Your first week is done! Let's reflect on it while we put into practice the skills we learned this week.

That includes:

- Terminal
- HTML & CSS
- Version Control & collaborating on a project

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a branch of your name `yourname-goals` - something like that.
  - Remember how to create branch? `git checkout -b <branchname>` (Do _not_ include the `<` `>` in the command)
3. Change directories into the room where you have class and you will see (by running the `ls` command) that there is a directory for you and each of your classmates.
4. `cd` into your directory and `ls` to find there is the scaffold for creating your goals page.
5. Before you start any coding, it's a good idea to create some wireframes for how you want your page to look. Feel free to go up to a whiteboard or use your Orange Method notebook for your wireframes. Spend at least 10 minutes (but no more than 30) creating your wireframes.

6. The `index.html` file is empty so include some boilerplate (`!` + `Tab`) and start developing based on your wireframes.

7. As soon as you get something working (& every time after that), do a `git add -A` then commit your changes with good, present-tense commit message.

  - Make commits often!

8. Once you are done with your changes and are ready to submit your page for review. Push _your branch_ back up to the remote repository you cloned from in GitHub.

  - `git push -u origin <your-branch-name-exactly-as-you-named-it-locally>`
  - since we used the `-u` flag, future pushes of this branch will only require a `git push`

9. Then come back to this page (the repository) and click new pull request:

![Pull Request](assets/compare-and-pull-request.png)

10. You will then get feedback in GitHub from an instructor about your code and the decisions you made.
